I think this is all kinda stupid and they should release better, more open tools. And update them more often to keep up with modern development practices, especially at the rates they charge users for their hardware. If I own hardware, I should be able to interact with it how I see fit. But that's just my opinion.

All of the stuff in this repository that ISN'T a campbell binary (as a compressed file or as a .exe) can be considered Apache/MIT at the user's discretion.
